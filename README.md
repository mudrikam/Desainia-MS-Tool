# I Built This Tool, So You Don't Have To

Desainia Microstock Tool was born from the daily challenges at Desainia Studio. As content creators, we faced the time-consuming task of managing and uploading content across multiple microstock platforms. What started as an internal solution to streamline our workflow has evolved into a tool we're proud to share with the community.

### If You're Wondering Why?

- **Time Saver**: Built to automate the boring stuff ‚Äî bulk uploads across multiple platforms, done in a flash.
- **Workflow Optimizer**: Helps you manage your files and metadata without losing your mind (or your deadlines).
- **Studio Tested**: Battle-tested daily at Desainia Studio, refined with real-world chaos in mind.
- **Community Driven**: Born from actual creator struggles, now shared freely with everyone who needs a little less pain in their process.

> **Disclaimer**: This tool is free for everyone, but comes with no warranty. Use it wisely, tweak it if you must ‚Äî you're in charge.
